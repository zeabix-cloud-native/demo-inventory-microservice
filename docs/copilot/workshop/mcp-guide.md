```

### 1.2 Configure MCP Settings

Add these settings to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  // Enhanced MCP Configuration
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "listCount": 15,
    "length": 1000,
    "contextualSuggestions": true
  },
  
  // Enable enhanced context awareness
  "github.copilot.chat.contextAwareness": "enhanced",
  "github.copilot.chat.includeWorkspaceContext": true,
  
  // MCP-specific settings
  "intellicode.enhance": {
    "enabled": true,
    "contextAnalysis": true,
    "projectPatterns": true
  },
  
  // Enhanced editor integration
  "editor.suggest.localityBonus": true,
  "editor.suggest.showStatusBar": true,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar": "always",

    "*.cs": "csharp",
    "*.tsx": "typescriptreact",
    "*.jsx": "javascriptreact",
    "copilot-instructions.md": "markdown"
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Workspace Configuration

Create `.vscode/settings.json` in your project root for MCP-specific project settings:

```json
{
  // Project-specific MCP configuration
  "github.copilot.chat.welcomeMessage": "custom",
  "github.copilot.chat.customWelcomeMessage": "Welcome to the Demo Inventory Microservice! This project uses Clean Architecture with .NET 9 backend and React 19 frontend. Use @workspace for project-aware assistance.",
  
  // Enhanced context for this project
  "github.copilot.preferences": {
    "architecture": "Clean Architecture",
    "backend": ".NET 9 with Entity Framework Core",
    "frontend": "React 19 with TypeScript",
    "database": "PostgreSQL",
    "testing": "xUnit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions, Vitest"
  },
  
  // File watchers for better context updates
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/bin/**": true,
    "**/obj/**": true,
    "**/.git/**": true
  }
}
```

### 1.4 Verify MCP Installation

**Test your MCP setup with this verification checklist:**

1. **Open Copilot Chat** (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)
2. **Test workspace awareness:**
   ```
   @workspace What is the architecture of this project?
   ```
3. **Test file context understanding:**
   ```
   @workspace Explain the ProductService.cs implementation pattern
   ```
4. **Test cross-file awareness:**
   ```
   @workspace How do the domain entities relate to the DTOs?
   ```

## üöÄ Step 2: Using MCP in VS Code

### 2.1 Enhanced Workspace Commands

**Project Context Commands:**
```
# Get project overview
@workspace Provide an overview of this microservice architecture

# Understand patterns
@workspace What coding patterns are used in this project?

# Analyze structure
@workspace Explain the folder structure and organization

# Review dependencies
@workspace What are the main dependencies and how are they organized?
```

**Architecture-Aware Development:**
```
# Create new features following patterns
@workspace Create a new CategoryService following the same pattern as ProductService

# Maintain consistency
@workspace Ensure this new controller follows the existing API patterns

# Cross-layer integration
@workspace How should this domain entity integrate with the existing infrastructure?
```

### 2.2 Context-Aware Code Generation

**Domain Layer Development:**
```csharp
// Example: MCP-enhanced entity creation
// Prompt: @workspace Create a Supplier entity following our domain patterns

public class Supplier : BaseEntity
{
    private readonly List<Product> _products = new();
    
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public string ContactEmail { get; private set; }
    public string ContactPhone { get; private set; }
    public Address Address { get; private set; }
    public SupplierStatus Status { get; private set; }
    
    // MCP understands existing patterns and generates accordingly
    public IReadOnlyCollection<Product> Products => _products.AsReadOnly();
    
    protected Supplier() { } // EF Core constructor
    
    public Supplier(string name, string contactEmail, Address address)
    {
        SetName(name);
        SetContactEmail(contactEmail);
        SetAddress(address);
        Status = SupplierStatus.Active;
    }
    
    // Business methods following established patterns
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name))
            throw new DomainException("Supplier name cannot be empty");
            
        Name = name;
    }
    
    // Additional domain methods...
}
```

### 2.3 Advanced MCP Prompting Techniques

**Layered Context Building:**
```
# Layer 1: Project Context
@workspace This is our .NET 9 Clean Architecture inventory microservice

# Layer 2: Feature Context  
I'm implementing supplier management functionality

# Layer 3: Technical Context
Following the same patterns as Product entity and ProductService

# Layer 4: Specific Request
Create SupplierRepository with async methods and proper error handling

# Layer 5: Quality Requirements
Include comprehensive logging, validation, and unit tests
```

**Cross-File Pattern Recognition:**
```
# Reference multiple files for pattern consistency
@workspace Using patterns from ProductService.cs and ProductRepository.cs, 
create SupplierService with the same error handling and logging approaches
```

## üß† Step 3: MCP Use Cases and Practices

### 3.1 Architecture Compliance

**Ensuring Clean Architecture Boundaries:**
```
# Validate layer dependencies
@workspace Check if this new service violates any Clean Architecture principles

# Verify dependency flow
@workspace Does this implementation maintain proper dependency inversion?

# Review interface segregation
@workspace Should this interface be split for better adherence to ISP?
```

**Pattern Consistency:**
```
# Maintain established patterns
@workspace Ensure this controller follows the same validation and error handling patterns as existing controllers

# Apply project conventions
@workspace Update this method to follow our async/await and logging conventions
```

### 3.2 Advanced Debugging with MCP

**Cross-File Issue Analysis:**
```
# Trace dependencies
@workspace This API endpoint is failing - analyze the full request flow from controller to repository

# Identify root causes
@workspace What could cause this entity validation to fail across multiple layers?

# Performance analysis
@workspace Analyze potential performance bottlenecks in this service method
```

**Integration Issue Resolution:**
```
# Database integration issues
@workspace The EF Core migration is failing - analyze the entity configuration and relationships

# API integration problems
@workspace The frontend can't consume this API endpoint - check serialization and DTO mapping
```

### 3.3 Testing Strategy with MCP

**Comprehensive Test Generation:**
```
# Unit test creation
@workspace Generate comprehensive unit tests for SupplierService using xUnit, NSubstitute, and FluentAssertions

# Integration test patterns
@workspace Create integration tests for SupplierController following existing API test patterns

# E2E test scenarios
@workspace Design E2E test scenarios for the complete supplier management workflow
```

**Test Quality Assurance:**
```
# Coverage analysis
@workspace Review test coverage for the supplier module and identify gaps

# Test pattern validation
@workspace Ensure these tests follow AAA pattern and testing best practices

# Edge case identification
@workspace What edge cases should be tested for supplier creation and validation?
```

### 3.4 Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

**Automated Documentation:**
```
# API documentation
@workspace Generate OpenAPI documentation for the new supplier endpoints

# Architecture documentation
@workspace Update the architecture documentation to include supplier management

```

## üîí Step 5: Security Enhancement with MCP

### 5.1 Security Analysis

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
```
# Security review
@workspace Perform security analysis on the supplier management implementation

# Input validation
@workspace Ensure all supplier inputs are properly validated and sanitized

# Authorization checks
@workspace Verify that proper authorization is implemented for supplier operations
```

### 5.2 Security Best Practices

**Secure Implementation:**
```
# Data protection
@workspace Implement data protection for sensitive supplier information
