## üé® Prompt Engineering Mastery

### 1.1 The Anatomy of an Effective Prompt

**Structure your prompts systematically:**

```
@workspace [Context] + [Task] + [Requirements] + [Constraints] + [Examples]
```

**Bad Prompt:**
```
Create a service
```

**Good Prompt:**
```
@workspace I'm working in the Application layer of a Clean Architecture .NET project. 
Create a CategoryAnalyticsService that calculates category statistics following the existing service patterns in the project.

Requirements:
- GetCategoryCountAsync() - total categories
- GetActiveCategoryPercentageAsync() - percentage of active categories  
- GetCategoryTrendsAsync(int days) - creation trends over time period

Constraints:
- Use dependency injection for ICategoryRepository and ILogger
- Follow async/await patterns consistently
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Return DTOs, not domain entities

Example of existing service pattern: ProductService.cs
Include comprehensive unit tests using xUnit, NSubstitute, and FluentAssertions.
```
**Trick: Prompt to create Prompt**
```
Give me an efective prompt to create <replace with thing you want to create>
Prompt structure should be: @workspace [Context] + [Task] + [Requirements] + [Constraints] + [Examples]
```

### 1.2 Context Layering Techniques

**Layer your context from general to specific:**

```
Layer 1: Project Context
@workspace This is a .NET 9 Clean Architecture microservice for inventory management.

Layer 2: Architectural Context  
I'm working in the [Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Presentation] layer.

Layer 3: Feature Context
I'm implementing category management functionality.

Layer 4: Specific Context
I need to add duplicate name validation that works across multiple concurrent requests.

Layer 5: Technical Context
Using Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL, dependency injection, and async patterns.
```

### 1.3 Iterative Prompt Refinement

**Start broad, then narrow down:**

```
Initial: @workspace Create a category validation service

Refinement 1: Include business rules for name uniqueness and length validation

Refinement 2: Add async database validation for duplicate names

Refinement 3: Handle concurrent validation scenarios with proper locking

Refinement 4: Add comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions

Refinement 5: Include performance optimization for batch validation
```

### 1.4 Domain-Specific Language

**Use your project's ubiquitous language:**

```
// Generic terms (avoid)
"Create a data class for storing information"

// Domain-specific terms (use)
"Create a Category aggregate root following DDD principles with invariants for business rule enforcement"
```

**Domain Term Dictionary for Prompts:**
- **Aggregate Root**: Main entity that controls access to its aggregate
- **Value Object**: Immutable object defined by its attributes
- **Repository**: Abstraction for data access operations
- **Domain Service**: Stateless service for domain logic that doesn't belong to an entity
- **Application Service**: Orchestrates domain operations and coordinates with infrastructure

## üß† Context Management Strategies

### 2.1 Workspace Context Optimization

**File Organization for Better Context:**
```bash
# Keep related files open
Category.cs (Domain)
ICategoryService.cs (Application) 
CategoryService.cs (Application)
CategoryRepository.cs (Infrastructure)
CategoriesController.cs (API)

# Copilot uses all open files for context
```

**Context Window Management:**
- Keep relevant files open in tabs
- Close unrelated files to reduce noise
- Use split views for related files
- Pin frequently referenced files

### 2.2 Reference Pattern Strategy

**Explicit Pattern References:**
```
@workspace Following the same pattern as ProductService.cs, create CategoryService with:
- Same dependency injection approach
- Same error handling strategy  
- Same logging pattern
- Same async/await usage
- Same DTO mapping approach
```

**Anti-Pattern Prevention:**
```
@workspace Create CategoryService but avoid these patterns from OldLegacyService.cs:
- Don't use direct database context access
- Don't mix business logic with data access
- Don't use synchronous database calls
- Don't return domain entities directly
```

### 2.3 Conversation Continuity

**Maintain Context Across Conversations:**
```
Conversation 1: Create Category entity
Conversation 2: Now create the service for the Category entity we just created
Conversation 3: Add the controller for the CategoryService we just implemented
Conversation 4: Create tests for all the Category components we've built
```

**Context Refresh Techniques:**
```
@workspace Let me remind you of what we've built so far:
1. Category domain entity with business rules
2. CategoryService with CRUD operations  
3. CategoriesController with REST endpoints
4. CategoryRepository with EF Core implementation

Now I need to add validation middleware for all category operations.
```

## üèÜ Code Quality Maintenance

### 3.1 Quality Gates in AI-Generated Code

**Always Verify These Aspects:**

**1. Architecture Compliance**
```csharp
‚úÖ Good: Domain entity with proper encapsulation
public class Category : BaseEntity
{
    public string Name { get; private set; } // Private setter
    
    public Category(string name) // Constructor validation
    {
        ValidateName(name);
        Name = name;
    }
}

‚ùå Bad: Anemic domain model
public class Category 
{
    public string Name { get; set; } // Public setter
    // No business logic or validation
}
```

**2. Error Handling**
```csharp
‚úÖ Good: Comprehensive error handling
public async Task<CategoryDto> CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
{
    try
    {
        ValidateDto(dto);
        var category = new Category(dto.Name, dto.Description);
        await _repository.AddAsync(category);
        return MapToDto(category);
    }
    catch (DomainValidationException ex)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Domain validation failed for category creation");
        throw;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Unexpected error creating category");
        throw new ServiceException("Failed to create category", ex);
    }
}

‚ùå Bad: No error handling
public async Task<CategoryDto> CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
{
    var category = new Category(dto.Name, dto.Description);
    await _repository.AddAsync(category);
    return MapToDto(category);
}
```

root = true

[*.cs]
# Enforce coding style
dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true
dotnet_separate_import_directive_groups = false

# Enforce async naming
dotnet_naming_rule.async_methods_should_end_with_async.severity = error
```

**Roslyn Analyzers:**
```xml
<!-- Directory.Build.props -->
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers" Version="3.3.4" PrivateAssets="all" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers" Version="7.0.0" PrivateAssets="all" />
  <PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" Version="1.1.118" PrivateAssets="all" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### 4.1 Security-First Prompting

**Always Include Security Context:**
```
@workspace Create a category search endpoint with the following security requirements:
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Authentication required for access
- Authorization based on user organization
- Audit logging for all search operations
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages
```

### 4.2 Common Security Pitfalls to Avoid

**Input Validation Issues:**
```csharp
‚ùå Dangerous: Direct SQL construction
var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Categories WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";

‚úÖ Secure: Parameterized queries
var categories = await _context.Categories
    .Where(c => EF.Functions.Like(c.Name, $"%{searchTerm}%"))
    .ToListAsync();
```

**Authorization Bypasses:**
```csharp
‚ùå Dangerous: No authorization check
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<CategoryDto> GetCategory(Guid id)
{
    return await _categoryService.GetByIdAsync(id);
}

‚úÖ Secure: Proper authorization
[HttpGet("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<CategoryDto> GetCategory(Guid id)
{
    var userId = User.GetUserId();
    return await _categoryService.GetByIdAsync(id, userId);
}
```

### 4.3 Security Review Process

**AI-Generated Code Security Checklist:**
- [ ] All inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal system information
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture and Design

### 4.1 Maintaining Clean Architecture

**Layer Dependency Rules:**
```
Presentation Layer (API Controllers, UI Components)
     ‚Üì (dependencies flow inward)
Application Layer (Services, DTOs, Interfaces) 
     ‚Üì
Domain Layer (Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services)
     ‚Üë (infrastructure implements domain interfaces)
Infrastructure Layer (Repositories, External Services)
```

**Prompt Templates for Each Layer:**

**Domain Layer:**
```
@workspace I'm working in the Domain layer following DDD principles. Create a [EntityName] aggregate root that:
- Encapsulates business rules for [specific business concept]
- Has private setters and constructor validation
- Includes business methods, not just properties
- Raises domain events for important state changes
- Has no dependencies on other layers
```

**Application Layer:**
```
@workspace I'm working in the Application layer following Clean Architecture. Create a [EntityName]Service that:
- Orchestrates domain operations without business logic
- Uses repository interfaces, not implementations
- Maps between domain entities and DTOs
- Handles cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation)
- Coordinates multiple domain operations in transactions
```

### 4.2 Design Pattern Application

**Repository Pattern:**
```
@workspace Implement the Repository pattern for Category entity following these principles:
- Interface in Application layer, implementation in Infrastructure
- Generic base repository with common operations
- Specific repository for complex Category queries
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- Specification pattern for complex query logic
```

**Factory Pattern:**
```
@workspace Create a CategoryFactory using the Factory pattern that:
- Encapsulates complex creation logic
- Validates input parameters
- Handles different category types (Product, Service, etc.)
- Integrates with dependency injection
- Includes proper error handling for invalid inputs
```

### 4.3 Microservice Readiness

**Prepare Code for Microservice Extraction:**
```
@workspace Design the Category service to be microservice-ready:
- Database schema independence from other bounded contexts
- Event-driven communication instead of direct service calls  
- Autonomous deployment capabilities
- Independent data management
- Well-defined service boundaries
- Idempotent operations for reliability
```

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### 5.1 Test-First Development with AI

**TDD Cycle with Copilot:**
```
1. Red Phase:
@workspace Following TDD, create failing unit tests for CategoryService.CreateAsync that should:
- Validate input parameters
- Check for duplicate category names
- Save to repository
- Return proper DTO
Don't implement the service yet - just the failing tests.

2. Green Phase:  
@workspace Now implement CategoryService.CreateAsync to make the tests pass with minimal code.

3. Refactor Phase:
@workspace Refactor the CategoryService.CreateAsync implementation to improve:
- Code clarity and readability
- Error handling completeness  
- Performance optimizations
Ensure all tests still pass.
```

### 5.2 Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Test Pyramid Approach:**
```
Unit Tests (Most):
@workspace Generate comprehensive unit tests for Category entity including:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Business rule validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Concurrency edge cases

Integration Tests (Some):
@workspace Create integration tests for CategoryController that:
- Test complete HTTP request/response cycle
- Validate database interactions
- Check error handling end-to-end
- Verify authentication/authorization

E2E Tests (Few):
@workspace Create E2E tests for category management that:
- Test complete user workflows
- Validate UI interactions
- Check cross-browser compatibility
- Verify performance under load
```

### 5.3 Test Quality Assurance

**Test Code Quality Standards:**
```
@workspace Review my test code for quality issues:
- Are test methods focused on single behaviors?
- Is test setup/teardown properly organized?
- Are assertions clear and specific?
- Is test data realistic and varied?
- Are error scenarios comprehensively covered?
- Do tests run fast and reliably?

Suggest improvements following testing best practices.
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Performance-Aware Development

**Query Performance:**
```
@workspace Create category queries optimized for performance:
- Use projection instead of loading full entities
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- Add database indexes for common query patterns
- Use compiled queries for frequently executed operations
- Avoid N+1 query problems with proper includes
```

**Caching Strategies:**
```
@workspace Implement a caching strategy for category data that:
- Uses memory cache for frequently accessed categories
- Implements distributed cache for scalability
- Has proper cache invalidation on updates
- Includes cache-aside pattern implementation
- Monitors cache hit/miss ratios
```

### 6.2 Resource Management

**Memory Management:**
```csharp
‚úÖ Good: Proper resource disposal
public async Task<IEnumerable<CategoryDto>> GetCategoriesAsync()
{
    using var connection = _connectionFactory.CreateConnection();
    using var command = connection.CreateCommand();
    // Proper disposal ensures memory cleanup
}

‚ùå Bad: Resource leaks
public async Task<IEnumerable<CategoryDto>> GetCategoriesAsync()
{
    var connection = _connectionFactory.CreateConnection();
    var command = connection.CreateCommand();
    // No disposal - potential memory leak
}
```

### 6.3 Performance Monitoring

**Add Performance Instrumentation:**
```
@workspace Add performance monitoring to CategoryService methods:
- Execution time measurement for each operation
- Memory usage tracking for large data operations
- Database query performance logging
- Cache hit/miss rate monitoring
- Custom performance counters for key metrics
```

## üë• Team Collaboration

### 7.1 Consistent AI Usage Across Team

**Team Prompt Standards:**
```
# Team Prompt Template
