## 🧪 Step 1: Test-Driven Development with Copilot

### 1.1 Understanding TDD with AI

Let's start with a TDD approach for a new feature. We'll add a **Category Analytics** service.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to practice Test-Driven Development for a new CategoryAnalyticsService. Following TDD principles, help me:

1. First, create failing unit tests for a service that should provide:
   - GetCategoryCountAsync() - total count of categories
   - GetActiveCategoryCountAsync() - count of active categories  
   - GetCategoryCreationTrendsAsync(int days) - creation trends over time
   - GetMostUsedCategoriesAsync(int limit) - most referenced categories

2. The tests should fail initially (red phase)
3. Follow the existing test patterns in the project
4. Use xUnit, NSubstitute, and FluentAssertions

Start with the failing tests only - don't implement the service yet.
```

### 1.2 Implement the Service (Green Phase)

After creating failing tests, ask Copilot to implement the service:

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Now implement the CategoryAnalyticsService to make the tests pass. The service should:
- Use dependency injection for ICategoryRepository and ILogger
- Implement all methods to satisfy the test requirements
- Follow the existing service patterns in the project
- Include proper error handling and logging

Implement just enough code to make the tests pass (green phase).
```

### 1.3 Refactor Phase

**Final prompt:**
```
Now refactor the CategoryAnalyticsService to improve:
- Code organization and readability
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling completeness
- Add any missing abstractions

Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring.
```
