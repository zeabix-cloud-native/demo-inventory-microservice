## üîß Step 1: Analyzing Exception Stack Traces

### 1.1 Common Exception Scenario

Let's start with a typical exception that might occur in production:

**Scenario**: Users report getting errors when creating categories with long names.

**Exception**:
```
System.ArgumentException: Category name cannot exceed 100 characters
   at DemoInventory.Domain.Entities.Category.ValidateName(String name)
   at DemoInventory.Domain.Entities.Category..ctor(String name, String description)
   at DemoInventory.Application.Services.CategoryService.CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
   at DemoInventory.API.Controllers.CategoriesController.CreateCategory(CreateCategoryDto dto)
```

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace Analyze this exception stack trace and help me understand the issue:

```

## üêå Step 2: Performance Debugging

### 2.1 Slow Query Investigation

**Scenario**: The categories list page is loading very slowly with large datasets.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I'm experiencing performance issues with the categories list. The page takes 10+ seconds to load when there are more than 1000 categories. 

Current CategoryRepository code:
```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<Category>> GetAllAsync()
{
    return await _context.Categories
        .Include(c => c.Products)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

Help me:
1. Identify the performance bottleneck
2. Optimize the query for better performance
3. Implement pagination to handle large datasets
4. Add proper indexes to the database
5. Create performance tests to monitor this

## üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Architecture Violation Debugging

### 3.1 Dependency Direction Violation

**Scenario**: Build fails with circular dependency error.

**Error Message**:
```
Error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'CategoryRepository' could not be found
Error: Circular dependency detected between Domain and Infrastructure layers
```

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I'm getting circular dependency errors in my Clean Architecture project. The error suggests Domain layer is trying to reference Infrastructure layer directly.

Project structure:
- Domain: Contains entities and business rules
- Application: Contains services and interfaces
- Infrastructure: Contains repository implementations
- API: Contains controllers

The error occurs when trying to build the solution. Help me:
1. Identify the architectural violation
2. Understand proper dependency direction in Clean Architecture
3. Fix the circular dependency
4. Implement proper dependency injection
5. Add validation to prevent future violations

```

### 3.2 Business Logic in Wrong Layer

**Scenario**: Business logic is leaking into the presentation layer.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I found business logic in my controller that should be in the domain or application layer:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateCategory([FromBody] CreateCategoryDto dto)
{
    // Business logic in controller - this is wrong!
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(dto.Name))
        return BadRequest("Name is required");
        
    if (dto.Name.Length > 100)
        return BadRequest("Name too long");
        
    var existingCategory = await _categoryService.GetByNameAsync(dto.Name);
    if (existingCategory != null)
        return Conflict("Category already exists");
        
    // More business logic here...
}
```

Help me:
1. Identify what should be moved to which layer
2. Refactor to follow Clean Architecture properly
3. Implement proper separation of concerns
4. Maintain proper error handling
5. Add tests for the refactored code

```

## üîó Step 4: Integration Bug Fixes

### 4.1 API Integration Issues

**Scenario**: Frontend can't communicate with the API properly.

**CORS Error**:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/categories' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
```

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I'm getting CORS errors when my React frontend tries to call the .NET API. The error is:

[paste CORS error]

Current API configuration in Program.cs:
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();

## ‚ö° Step 5: Concurrency and Threading Issues

### 5.1 Race Condition Bug

**Scenario**: Duplicate categories are being created despite validation.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I have a race condition in my CategoryService. Multiple users can create categories with the same name simultaneously, bypassing the duplicate check:

```csharp
public async Task<CategoryDto> CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
{
    // Check for existing category
    var existing = await _repository.GetByNameAsync(dto.Name);
    if (existing != null)
        throw new DuplicateException("Category already exists");
        
    // Create new category - race condition here!
    var category = new Category(dto.Name, dto.Description);
    await _repository.AddAsync(category);
    
    return MapToDto(category);
}
```

This creates duplicates when multiple requests arrive simultaneously. Help me:
1. Identify the race condition
2. Implement proper concurrency control
3. Use database constraints as a safety net
4. Handle concurrent modification gracefully
5. Add tests for concurrent scenarios

Provide thread-safe implementation with proper error handling.
```

### 5.2 Deadlock Resolution

**Scenario**: Application occasionally hangs with database operations.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I'm experiencing deadlocks in my application when multiple users perform category operations simultaneously. The application hangs and I see deadlock errors in the database logs.

Current transaction usage:
```csharp
public async Task<bool> UpdateCategoryAsync(Guid id, UpdateCategoryDto dto)
{
    using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();
    try
    {
        var category = await _context.Categories.FindAsync(id);
        // Update operations
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        await transaction.CommitAsync();
        return true;
    }
    catch
    {
        await transaction.RollbackAsync();
        throw;
    }
}
```

Help me:
1. Identify deadlock causes
2. Implement proper transaction ordering
3. Use appropriate isolation levels
4. Add deadlock retry logic
5. Monitor and detect deadlock patterns

Provide deadlock-free implementation with monitoring.
```

## üé® Step 6: Frontend Bug Fixes

### 6.1 State Management Issues

**Scenario**: React components show stale data after updates.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace My React components are showing stale data after category updates. The API call succeeds, but the UI doesn't reflect changes immediately.

Current useCategories hook:
```typescript
export const useCategories = () => {
  const [categories, setCategories] = useState<Category[]>([]);
  
  const updateCategory = async (id: string, data: UpdateCategoryRequest) => {
    await categoryApi.updateCategory(id, data);
    // UI doesn't update - stale data issue
  };
  
  return { categories, updateCategory };
};
```

The issue is that after updating, the list still shows old data. Help me:
1. Identify the state synchronization issue
2. Implement optimistic updates
3. Handle update failures gracefully
4. Add proper cache invalidation
5. Ensure UI consistency

Provide proper state management solution.
```

### 6.2 Form Validation Issues

**Scenario**: Form allows invalid data submission despite validation.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace My CategoryForm has validation issues. Users can submit invalid data even though validation rules exist:

```typescript
const validateCategory = (data: CreateCategoryRequest): ValidationErrors => {
  const errors: ValidationErrors = {};
  
  if (!data.name?.trim()) {
    errors.name = 'Name is required';
  }
  
  if (data.name && data.name.length > 100) {
    errors.name = 'Name cannot exceed 100 characters';
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

But users report being able to submit empty forms and seeing server errors. Help me:
1. Fix client-side validation gaps
2. Implement real-time validation feedback
3. Prevent form submission with invalid data
4. Handle server validation errors properly
5. Improve user experience with better error messages

Provide comprehensive form validation solution.
```

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I need to review my application for security vulnerabilities. I'm concerned about:

1. SQL injection in search functionality
2. XSS in category names and descriptions
3. Input validation bypass
4. Authentication/authorization gaps

Current search implementation:
```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<Category>> SearchAsync(string searchTerm)
{
    var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Categories WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
    return await _context.Categories.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToListAsync();
}
```

Help me:
1. Identify security vulnerabilities
2. Implement proper input sanitization
3. Use parameterized queries
4. Add comprehensive validation
5. Implement security testing

```

### 7.2 Authorization Bypass

**Scenario**: Users can access categories they shouldn't see.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I discovered users can access categories from other organizations by guessing URLs. My current controller doesn't check ownership:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<ActionResult<CategoryDto>> GetCategory(Guid id)
{
    var category = await _categoryService.GetByIdAsync(id);
    if (category == null)
        return NotFound();
        
    return Ok(category);
}
```

This allows any authenticated user to access any category. Help me:
1. Implement proper authorization checks
2. Add organization-based access control
3. Secure all endpoints consistently
4. Add authorization testing
