## üîç Step 1: Code Smell Detection and Analysis

### 1.1 Automated Code Review

Let's start by having Copilot analyze our existing code for improvements.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to perform a comprehensive code review of the Category feature we've built. Please analyze the following areas for potential improvements:

1. Code smells (long methods, duplicate code, complex conditions)
2. SOLID principle violations
3. Performance inefficiencies
4. Architecture boundary violations
5. Error handling inconsistencies
6. Test coverage gaps
7. Documentation needs

Review these files and provide specific improvement recommendations:
- Category entity
- CategoryService
- CategoryRepository
- CategoriesController
- React components (CategoryCard, CategoryList, CategoryForm)

For each issue identified, provide:
- Why it's a problem
- Severity level (High/Medium/Low)
- Specific refactoring suggestions
- Expected benefits of the change
```

### 1.2 Prioritizing Refactoring Tasks

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Based on your analysis, help me prioritize the refactoring tasks:

1. Create a refactoring backlog with items sorted by:
   - Impact on code quality
   - Risk of introducing bugs
   - Development effort required
   - Business value

2. Group related refactoring tasks that should be done together

3. Identify any breaking changes that require coordination

4. Suggest a refactoring timeline and approach

Provide a structured refactoring plan with clear milestones.
```

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: SOLID Principles Refactoring

### 2.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Scenario**: The CategoryService is doing too many things.

**Current problematic code**:
```csharp
public class CategoryService : ICategoryService
{
    public async Task<CategoryDto> CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
    {
        // Validation logic
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(dto.Name))
            throw new ArgumentException("Name required");
            
        // Business logic
        var category = new Category(dto.Name, dto.Description);
        
        // Data access
        await _repository.AddAsync(category);
        
        // Mapping logic
        return new CategoryDto
        {
            Id = category.Id,
            Name = category.Name,
            // ... more mapping
        };
        
        // Notification logic
        await _notificationService.SendCategoryCreatedNotification(category);
        
        // Caching logic
        _cache.Remove("categories_all");
        
        // Logging
        _logger.LogInformation("Category created: {CategoryId}", category.Id);
    }
}
```

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace The CategoryService violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling multiple concerns. Help me refactor this into separate, focused classes:

[paste the problematic code above]

I want to separate:
1. Validation logic into a validator
2. Mapping logic into a mapper service
3. Notification logic into a domain event system
4. Caching logic into a caching service
5. Keep core business orchestration in the service

Please provide:
1. Separate classes for each responsibility
2. Updated CategoryService that orchestrates these services
3. Proper dependency injection configuration
4. Unit tests for each separated component

Follow Clean Architecture principles and existing patterns in the project.
```

### 2.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Scenario**: Adding new category types requires modifying existing code.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I need to add different category types (ProductCategory, ServiceCategory, etc.) but my current design requires modifying existing code each time. Help me refactor to follow the Open/Closed Principle:

Current inflexible design:
```csharp
public class Category
{
    public CategoryType Type { get; set; }
    
    public void ApplyBusinessRules()
    {
        switch (Type)
        {
            case CategoryType.Product:
                // Product-specific rules
                break;
            case CategoryType.Service:
                // Service-specific rules
                break;
            // Adding new types requires modifying this method
        }
    }
}
```

Please provide:
1. Abstract base class or interface design
2. Concrete implementations for different category types
3. Factory pattern for creating appropriate types
4. Strategy pattern for business rules
5. Updated service layer to handle polymorphism

Ensure the solution allows adding new category types without modifying existing code.
```

### 2.3 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Scenario**: High-level modules depend on low-level modules.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I have dependency inversion violations where high-level business logic depends on low-level implementation details. Help me refactor:

Current violation:
```csharp
public class CategoryService
{
    private readonly CategoryRepository _repository; // Concrete dependency
    private readonly EmailService _emailService; // Concrete dependency
    
    public async Task CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
    {
        // Business logic coupled to concrete implementations
        var category = await _repository.AddAsync(new Category(dto.Name));
        await _emailService.SendNotification("Category created", category.Name);
    }
}
```

Please provide:
1. Proper abstractions for all dependencies
2. Interface segregation for different concerns
3. Dependency injection configuration
4. Mock-friendly design for testing
5. Flexible implementation swapping

Ensure all dependencies point toward abstractions, not concretions.
```

## üé® Step 3: Design Pattern Implementation

### 3.1 Repository Pattern Enhancement

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to enhance my repository pattern to be more flexible and powerful. Current implementation is basic:

```csharp
public interface ICategoryRepository
{
    Task<Category> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
    Task<IEnumerable<Category>> GetAllAsync();
    Task AddAsync(Category category);
    Task UpdateAsync(Category category);
    Task DeleteAsync(Guid id);
}
```

Help me refactor to include:
1. Specification pattern for complex queries
2. Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
3. Generic repository base for common operations
4. Query object pattern for advanced filtering
5. Repository factory for different data sources

Provide:
- Enhanced interfaces and implementations
- Specification classes for common queries
- Unit of Work implementation
- Usage examples in the service layer
- Tests for the new patterns

Follow existing project patterns and Clean Architecture principles.
```

### 3.2 Factory Pattern for Entity Creation

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to implement the Factory pattern for creating Category entities with different configurations and validation. Current creation is scattered:

```csharp
// In various places
var category1 = new Category(name, description);
var category2 = new Category(name, description) { IsActive = false };
// Complex initialization logic duplicated
```

Help me create:
1. CategoryFactory with different creation methods
2. Builder pattern for complex category construction
3. Abstract factory for different category types
4. Validation integration in the factory
5. Factory registration in DI container

Provide:
- Factory interfaces and implementations
- Builder pattern implementation
- Integration with existing service layer
- Tests for factory methods
- Usage examples

Ensure the factory encapsulates creation complexity and validation.
```

### 3.3 Observer Pattern for Domain Events

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to implement domain events using the Observer pattern for category operations. Currently, side effects are handled directly in services:

```csharp
public async Task CreateCategoryAsync(CreateCategoryDto dto)
{
    var category = new Category(dto.Name, dto.Description);
    await _repository.AddAsync(category);
    
    // Side effects handled directly - tight coupling
    await _emailService.SendNotification(...);
    await _auditService.LogCreation(...);
    _cache.InvalidateCategories();
}
```

Help me implement:
1. Domain event infrastructure
2. Event handlers for different concerns
3. Event dispatcher/mediator pattern
4. Integration with Entity Framework
5. Async event processing

Provide:
- Domain event base classes and interfaces
- Event handlers for notifications, auditing, caching
- Event dispatcher implementation
- Integration with existing domain entities
- Tests for event handling

Ensure loose coupling and easy addition of new event handlers.
```

## ‚ö° Step 4: Performance Optimization Refactoring

### 4.1 Query Optimization

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I need to optimize database queries for better performance. Current implementation has N+1 problems and inefficient queries:

```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<CategoryWithProductCountDto>> GetCategoriesWithProductCountAsync()
{
    var categories = await _context.Categories.ToListAsync();
    var result = new List<CategoryWithProductCountDto>();
    
    foreach (var category in categories) // N+1 problem
    {
        var productCount = await _context.Products
            .CountAsync(p => p.CategoryId == category.Id);
        result.Add(new CategoryWithProductCountDto
        {
            Category = category,
            ProductCount = productCount
        });
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

Help me refactor for optimal performance:
1. Eliminate N+1 queries with proper joins
2. Implement projection for DTOs
3. Add pagination for large datasets
4. Use compiled queries for frequently used operations
5. Implement query result caching

Provide optimized implementations with performance comparisons.
```

### 4.2 Caching Strategy Implementation

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to implement a comprehensive caching strategy for the Category feature. Currently, no caching is implemented, leading to repeated database calls.

Help me implement:
1. Multi-level caching (memory, distributed)
2. Cache-aside pattern for category data
3. Cache invalidation strategies
4. Cache warming for frequently accessed data
5. Cache metrics and monitoring

Consider these scenarios:
- Individual category lookup (by ID, by name)
- Category lists with different filters
- Category counts and statistics
- Search results

Provide:
- Caching interfaces and implementations
- Cache key generation strategies
- Invalidation logic
- Integration with existing services
- Performance monitoring

Ensure cache consistency and proper invalidation.
```

### 4.3 Memory Usage Optimization

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to optimize memory usage in the Category feature. Current implementation may have memory issues with large datasets:

```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<CategoryDto>> GetAllCategoriesAsync()
{
    var categories = await _context.Categories
        .Include(c => c.Products)
        .ToListAsync(); // Loads everything into memory
    
    return categories.Select(c => new CategoryDto
    {
        // Full object mapping
        Id = c.Id,
        Name = c.Name,
        Description = c.Description,
        Products = c.Products.Select(p => new ProductDto { ... }).ToList()
    });
}
```

Help me refactor for better memory efficiency:
1. Streaming data processing for large datasets
2. Projection to avoid loading unnecessary data
3. Pagination with cursors for better performance
4. Memory pooling for object creation
5. Disposal patterns for resources

Provide memory-efficient implementations with measurement techniques.
```

## üèõÔ∏è Step 5: Architecture Refactoring

### 5.1 Clean Architecture Boundary Enforcement

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace I want to ensure strict Clean Architecture boundaries are maintained. Help me refactor to eliminate any boundary violations:

Current potential violations:
1. Domain entities referencing infrastructure concerns
2. Application services directly using EF Core types
3. UI models mixed with domain models
4. Cross-cutting concerns spread across layers

Help me:
1. Implement strict layer interfaces
2. Create proper DTOs for each layer boundary
3. Add architectural unit tests to prevent violations
4. Implement cross-cutting concern handling
5. Document architectural decisions

Provide:
- Cleaned-up layer interfaces
