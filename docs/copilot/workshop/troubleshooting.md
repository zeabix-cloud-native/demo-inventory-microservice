## üìâ Poor Code Quality

### Issue: Copilot Generates Wrong Patterns

**Symptoms:**
- Code doesn't follow project conventions
- Incorrect architectural patterns
- Outdated or deprecated approaches

**Root Cause:** Insufficient context or conflicting patterns in codebase

**Solutions:**

**1. Improve Context Provision:**
```
‚ùå Bad prompt:
"Create a service"

‚úÖ Good prompt:
"@workspace Create CategoryService in Application layer following Clean Architecture. 
Use the same pattern as ProductService.cs with:
- Dependency injection for repository and logger
- Async/await throughout
- DTO mapping
- Comprehensive error handling
- Following our established naming conventions"
```

**2. Clean Up Conflicting Patterns:**
```
1. Identify inconsistent code patterns in your project
2. Standardize on preferred approaches
3. Remove or refactor legacy code that confuses Copilot
4. Add clear examples of preferred patterns
```

**3. Use Explicit Pattern References:**
```
@workspace Follow exactly the same pattern as ProductService.cs but for Categories:
- Same constructor pattern
- Same method signatures
- Same error handling approach
- Same logging format
- Same async/await usage
```

### Issue: Generated Code Lacks Error Handling

**Symptoms:**
- Missing try-catch blocks
- No validation logic
- Unhandled edge cases

**Solutions:**

**1. Always Request Error Handling:**
```
@workspace Create CategoryService.CreateAsync with comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation with custom exceptions
- Database constraint violation handling
- Logging for all error scenarios
- Proper exception propagation
- Graceful degradation where appropriate
```

**2. Provide Error Handling Examples:**
```
@workspace Follow this error handling pattern from ProductService:

try
{
    ValidateInput(dto);
    var entity = CreateEntity(dto);
    await _repository.SaveAsync(entity);
    return MapToDto(entity);
}
catch (ValidationException ex)
{
    _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Validation failed for {Operation}", nameof(CreateAsync));
    throw;
}
catch (DuplicateException ex)
{
    _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Duplicate entity in {Operation}", nameof(CreateAsync));
    throw;
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Unexpected error in {Operation}", nameof(CreateAsync));
    throw new ServiceException("Operation failed", ex);
}
```

### Issue: Code Doesn't Follow Clean Architecture

**Symptoms:**
- Domain layer has infrastructure dependencies
- Controllers contain business logic
- Repositories have business rules

**Solutions:**

**1. Specify Layer Context Explicitly:**
```
@workspace I'm working in the DOMAIN layer of Clean Architecture. 
Create Category entity that:
- Has NO dependencies on other layers
- Contains business rules and invariants
- Uses private setters for encapsulation
- Has factory methods for creation
- Raises domain events when appropriate
```

**2. Review and Enforce Boundaries:**
```
@workspace Review this code for Clean Architecture violations:

[paste code here]

Check for:
- Domain depending on Infrastructure
- Application containing business logic
- Infrastructure containing business rules
- Presentation handling domain concerns

Suggest refactoring to fix any violations.
```

## üß† Context Problems

### Issue: Copilot Doesn't Understand Project Structure

**Symptoms:**
- Generated code doesn't match project patterns
- Wrong namespaces or imports
- Incorrect file placement suggestions

**Solutions:**

**1. Optimize File Organization:**
```
Keep these files open when working:
‚úÖ Target file you're editing
‚úÖ Related interface/base class
‚úÖ Similar implementation for reference
‚úÖ Test file for the component
‚úÖ Configuration files if relevant

Close unrelated files to reduce noise.
```

**2. Provide Explicit Structure Context:**
```
@workspace Project structure context:
- Domain layer: /backend/src/DemoInventory.Domain
- Application layer: /backend/src/DemoInventory.Application  
- Infrastructure: /backend/src/DemoInventory.Infrastructure
- API layer: /backend/src/DemoInventory.API
- Tests: /backend/tests/

I'm creating CategoryService in Application layer, following the pattern of ProductService.
```

**3. Use Workspace References:**
```
@workspace Analyze the existing project structure and patterns:
1. How are services organized in the Application layer?
2. What's the naming convention for interfaces?
3. How is dependency injection configured?
4. What's the standard error handling approach?

Then create CategoryService following these discovered patterns.
```

### Issue: Generated Code Uses Wrong Dependencies

**Symptoms:**
- Incorrect NuGet packages referenced
- Wrong framework versions
- Deprecated libraries used

**Solutions:**

**1. Specify Technology Stack:**
```
@workspace Technology stack context:
- .NET 9 with C# 12
- Entity Framework Core 9.0
- PostgreSQL with Npgsql
- xUnit for testing
- NSubstitute for mocking
- FluentAssertions for test assertions
- Serilog for logging

Create CategoryRepository using these specific technologies.
```

**2. Reference Project Files:**
```
@workspace Check the existing .csproj files to understand our dependencies:
- Look at DemoInventory.Application.csproj
- Check DemoInventory.Infrastructure.csproj  
- Review test project dependencies

Use only the packages already referenced in the project.
```

## ‚ö° Performance Issues

### Issue: Copilot Responses Are Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Long delays for suggestions
- Timeouts in chat responses
- Incomplete code generation

**Solutions:**

**1. Optimize Context Size:**
```
# Reduce context noise
1. Close unnecessary files and tabs
2. Clear output/terminal windows
3. Minimize open extensions
4. Use specific rather than broad prompts
```

**2. Break Down Complex Requests:**
```
‚ùå Complex request:
"Create complete Category feature with entity, service, repository, controller, tests, and documentation"

‚úÖ Broken down:
Step 1: "Create Category domain entity with business rules"
Step 2: "Create ICategoryService interface"  
Step 3: "Implement CategoryService"
Step 4: "Create CategoryRepository"
... and so on
```

**3. Use More Specific Prompts:**
```
‚ùå Vague: "Fix the performance issue"
‚úÖ Specific: "Optimize this LINQ query to avoid N+1 problem by using Include() for related data"
```

### Issue: Generated Code Has Performance Problems

**Symptoms:**
- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks

**Solutions:**

**1. Request Performance-Optimized Code:**
```
@workspace Create CategoryService.GetCategoriesWithProductCountAsync optimized for performance:
- Avoid N+1 queries using proper joins
- Use projection to select only needed data
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add appropriate database indexes
- Include query execution time logging
```

**2. Review for Common Performance Issues:**
```
@workspace Review this code for performance issues:

[paste code]

Check for:
- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient LINQ operations
- Unnecessary data loading
- Missing async/await
- Resource disposal issues
- Memory allocation patterns

Suggest optimizations with explanations.
```

public void Domain_Should_Not_Reference_Infrastructure()
{
    var domainAssembly = Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(Category));
    var infrastructureAssembly = Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(CategoryRepository));
    
    var domainTypes = domainAssembly.GetTypes();
    var infrastructureTypes = infrastructureAssembly.GetTypes();
    
    foreach (var domainType in domainTypes)
    {
        var dependencies = domainType.GetReferencedAssemblies();
        dependencies.Should().NotContain(infrastructureAssembly.GetName());
    }
}
```

### Issue: SOLID Principle Violations

**Symptoms:**
- Classes with multiple responsibilities
- Tight coupling between components
