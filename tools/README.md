# Validation Tools

This directory contains automated code validation tools for the Demo Inventory Microservice project with **severity-specific recommendations**.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run all validations is using the helper script:

```bash
# Run all validations on current directory
./tools/run-validation.sh

# Run with verbose output (recommended for detailed severity analysis)
./tools/run-validation.sh --verbose

# Validate specific path
./tools/run-validation.sh --path backend/src

# Generate comprehensive JSON report with severity metrics
./tools/run-validation.sh --report validation-report.json

# Generate CTRF format report for CI/CD integration
./tools/run-validation.sh --ctrf security-results.json

# Skip specific validations
./tools/run-validation.sh --skip security,architecture

# Combine multiple output formats for comprehensive analysis
./tools/run-validation.sh --verbose --report full-report.json --ctrf ci-report.json
```

## 🆕 Enhanced Features

### New Command Line Options
All validation tools now support enhanced command-line options for better integration:

```bash
# Basic options
--path PATH          # Specify validation target (file or directory)
--verbose           # Enable detailed output with issue explanations
--help              # Show comprehensive help and usage examples

# Report generation
--report FILE       # Generate comprehensive JSON report with metrics
--ctrf FILE         # Generate CTRF format report for CI/CD integration
--skip TYPES        # Skip specific validation types (static,security,architecture)
```

### Enhanced Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick validation with enhanced output
./tools/run-validation.sh --verbose

# Generate multiple report formats for different use cases
./tools/run-validation.sh --report analysis.json --ctrf ci-pipeline.json

# Validate specific components with targeted output
./tools/run-validation.sh --path backend/src --verbose --ctrf security-only.json --skip static,architecture

# CI/CD integration with comprehensive reporting
./tools/run-validation.sh --report quality-gate.json --ctrf security-gate.json --verbose
```

### Severity-Specific Recommendations
All validation tools now provide **targeted recommendations for each severity level**:

- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required, deployment blocked
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Address within 24-48 hours, prioritize over features  
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Plan for current sprint, safe to deploy
- 🔵 **LOW**: Technical debt, address during maintenance

### Priority-Based Action Plans
- **Implementation timelines** for each severity level
- **Resource allocation** guidance (junior dev, senior dev, all hands)
- **Deployment impact** assessment for each issue type
- **Testing requirements** based on severity

### Enhanced Output & Reporting

- **Comprehensive validation summary** with execution timeline and target information
- **Visual severity indicators** with color-coded emojis and detailed issue context
- **Detailed category breakdown** (Documentation, Security, Architecture)
- **Actionable guidance** specific to each issue type with implementation timelines
- **Multiple report formats** - JSON for comprehensive analysis, CTRF for CI/CD integration
- **Enhanced console logging** with validation progress and detailed completion status

## Integration

### Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline
Add to your GitHub Actions workflow with severity-aware reporting and CTRF integration:

```yaml
- name: Run Code Validation with Enhanced Reporting
  run: ./tools/run-validation.sh --report validation-report.json --ctrf security-ctrf.json --verbose

- name: Check Critical Issues
  run: |
    if grep -q '"critical":' validation-report.json && ! grep -q '"critical": 0' validation-report.json; then
      echo "CRITICAL issues found - blocking deployment"
      exit 1
    fi

- name: Upload CTRF Security Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    name: security-ctrf-report
    path: security-ctrf.json
```

### Enhanced Pre-commit Hook
Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with severity checking and enhanced output:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
./tools/run-validation.sh --path "." --verbose
EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ $EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "🔴 Code quality issues found - commit blocked"
    echo "   └─ Review the detailed output above for specific recommendations"
    echo "   └─ Use --skip for non-critical changes or fix issues before committing"
    echo "   └─ Generate reports with: ./tools/run-validation.sh --report analysis.json"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Code quality validation passed - commit allowed"
```

## Enhanced JSON Report Format

The validation now generates two types of reports:

### 1. Comprehensive JSON Report (`--report`)
Detailed analysis with metrics and recommendations:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-16T09:54:10Z",
  "summary": {
    "totalTools": 3,
    "passedTools": 3,
    "failedTools": 0,
    "totalDuration": 7740.5
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "validationName": "Security Scan",
      "success": true,
      "duration": 2739.07,
      "metrics": [
        "Critical: 0",
        "High: 11",

## Severity Guidelines

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Immediate Action)
- **Timeline**: Fix within hours, before any deployment
- **Resources**: All hands on deck, escalate to tech lead/architect  
- **Deployment**: BLOCKED until all critical issues resolved
- **Examples**: SQL injection, architectural violations, hardcoded secrets

### 🟠 HIGH (24-48 Hours)
- **Timeline**: Resolve this sprint, prioritize over new features
- **Resources**: Senior developer review, pair programming recommended

- **Examples**: High complexity, authorization missing, sensitive data exposure

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Current Sprint)
- **Timeline**: Address within current or next sprint
- **Resources**: Regular development workflow
- **Deployment**: Safe to deploy with planned fixes
- **Examples**: Missing documentation, input validation, moderate complexity

### 🔵 LOW (Technical Debt)
- **Timeline**: Address during maintenance windows
- **Resources**: Junior developers, code review process
- **Deployment**: No deployment blockers
- **Examples**: Naming conventions, minor improvements, code hygiene

2. Follow the **IssueSeverity/SecurityLevel** patterns for consistency
3. Add **actionable, severity-specific recommendations** for each issue type
4. Update tests in the `Tests` project with **severity validation**
5. Update documentation with **enhanced examples and guidance**

## Support
